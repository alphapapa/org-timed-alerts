If you've stumbled upon this, you've done it before I've told anyone about this. In progress. Use at your own risk. 
* org-timed-alerts
Receive warnings and alerts via =alert.el= for upcoming events in your day.

Ever look at your clock 10 minutes before a scheduled phone call, keep working on something else, and then not look at your clock until 2 minutes after the phone call was supposed to begin?

=org-timed-alerts= will scan your agenda files, find any timestamps (active, deadline, or scheduled) with a time of day specification and then send warnings via =alert.el= according to whatever intervals you specifcy. When the event begins, it will send a final alert. Alert messages are easily customizable. 

=org-timed-alerts= updates itself via =org-agenda-hook=. This is fast enough that I don't notice much speed difference when generating an agenda.

*** alert strings
=org-timed-alert-final-alert-string= and =org-timed-alert-warning-string= are strings that allow the following substitutions:

| string        | substitution                                                              |
|---------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| %todo         | the TODO state of the the heading, if any                                 |
| %headline     | the headline text of the heading                                          |
| %alert-time   | the time of the event                                                     |
| %warning-time | the current number of minutes before the event                            |
| %current-time | the time the alert is actually sent to the user                           |
| %category     | the category property of the org heading, or the name of the file if none |

For example, consider the heading:
#+begin_src org 
* TODO phone conference I don't want to have
:PROPERTIES:
:CATEGORY: annoying-client
:END:
<2020-11-23 Mon 15:45>
#+end_src
The following string:
=%todo %headline\n at %alert-time\n it is now %current-time\n * THIS IS YOUR %warning-time MINUTE WARNING *=
Will use these substitutions
| string        | substitution                            |
|---------------+-----------------------------------------|
| %todo         | "TODO"                                  |
| %headline     | "phone conference I don't want to have" |
| %alert-time   | "20:05"                                 |
| %warning-time | "5"                                     |
| %current-time | "20:00"                                 |
| %category     | "annoying-client"                       |

And will display a warning that looks like this:
[[./images/sample-alert.png]]

The title of the alert defaults to the CATEGORY property of the org heading, or the file name if no category is specified.

* How it works
 1. Run an org-ql query to get all active timestamps, scheduled timestamps, and deadlines on the current date.
 2. For each of these events which has an associated time:
    1. Create a timer to send an alert at that time via alert.el. This alert will use the string =org-timed-alert-final-alert-string=
    2. Create warning timers according to the intervals specified in =org-timed-alerts-warning-times= and using the string =org-timed-alert-warning-string=
 3. Update all timers any time the user runs =org-agenda=. You can update manually with =org-timed-alerts-set-all-timers=. You can disable all timers with =org-timed-alerts-cancel-all-timers= or by disabling the minor mode. 
* Other efforts
This pacakge is meant to do what I want and and nothing more; I tried to abstract a bit so others might find it useful. 

It is possible that these packages provide this (or additional) functionality. I did not do extensive testing before writing my own. They may be suitable for your purposes:

=org-alert=. /See/ https://github.com/spegoraro/org-alert.

=org-notify=. /See/ https://code.orgmode.org/bzg/org-mode/raw/master/contrib/lisp/org-notify.el.

=org-wild-notify=. /See/ https://github.com/akhramov/org-wild-notifier.el.

* Org-timer-alerts
Receive alerts via =alert.el= for upcoming events in your day. 
* Use-package
Here is my use-package declaration:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp :results silent
  (use-package org-timer-alerts
    :custom ((org-timer-alerts-default-warning-times '(-20 -10 -5 -2))
             (org-timer-alerts-default-alert-props '(:icon ""))
             (org-timer-alert-final-alert-string "IT IS %alert-time\n\n%todo %headline")
             (org-timer-alert-warning-string (concat "%todo %headline\n at %alert-time\n "
                                                     "it is now %current-time\n "
                                                     "*THIS IS YOUR %warning-time MINUTE WARNING*")))
    :init
    (add-hook 'org-mode #'org-timer-alerts-mode))
#+end_src
* How it works
 1. Run an org-ql query to get all active timestamps, scheduled timestamps, and deadlines on the current date.
 2. For each of these events which has an associated time:
    1. Create a timer to send an alert at that time via alert.el. This alert will use the string =org-timer-alert-final-alert-string=
    2. Create warning timers according to the intervals specified in =org-timer-alerts-warning-times= and using the string =org-timer-alert-warning-string=
 3. Update all timers any time the user runs =org-agenda=. You can update manually with =org-timer-alerts-set-all-timers=.
